#+title: ~org-bet~ (rough draft that I may not finish)

File markets and bets in ~org-mode~.

I got tired of Manifold testing their website on me so I decided to just make mana in emacs.

* Manifold Markets API key for ~POST~ requests
Which you get on ~manifold.markets/profile~ after signing in with google SSO, but I see no reason to restrict ~GET~ requests to key havers.

A little later should be something like
#+begin_src
$ cat ~/.auth
machine https://manifold.markets/api login apikey password <rationalussy>
#+end_src

* I called it ~org-bet~ instead of ~org-manifold~ because presumably we could expand it to other betting platforms. Lmao.
