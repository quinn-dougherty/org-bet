#+title: ~org-bet~ (rough draft that I may not finish)

File markets and bets in ~org-mode~.

I got tired of Manifold testing their website on me so I decided to just make mana in emacs.

* Manifold Markets and Fatebook API keys for ~POST~ requests
Which you get on ~manifold.markets/profile~ after signing in with google SSO, but I see no reason to restrict ~GET~ requests to key havers.

A little later should be something like
#+begin_src
$ cat ~/.authinfo
machine https://manifold.markets/api login apikey password <rationalussy>
machine https://fatebook.io/api/ login apikey password <rationalussy>
$ gpg -c ~/.authinfo
#+end_src
